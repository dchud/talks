Some things Aaron Swartz did

   > "How was the spec developed? Was it done through email discussion
   between the authors? If so, why did you choose this route, instead
   of a more public method? Would you be open to making the archives
   of this discussion available, so we could see the reasons behind
   some of the decisions?"

   > "Who wrote this spec? How did they get chosen? How did they write
   it? Will transcripts of that discussion be made available? Why
   did you choose a closed process rather than an open one?

   > Don't misunderstand - I'm very thankful for the work you've done,
   just curious why you've dropped a finished spec into our laps
   without asking for public input. I'd appreciate it if you could
   explain a bit more about the thinking behind the process."

Who writes wikipedia?
---------------------

   *September 4, 2006*

   > "When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider
   makes one edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make
   several edits tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders
   rack up thousands of edits doing things like changing the name
   of a category across the entire site — the kind of thing only
   insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for
   the vast majority of the edits. But it's the outsiders who provide
   nearly all of the content.

   > And when you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Writing
   an encyclopedia is hard. To do anywhere near a decent job, you
   have to know a great deal of information about an incredibly
   wide variety of subjects. Writing so much text is difficult, but
   doing all the background research seems impossible."

   > ...

   > "If Wikipedia is written by occasional contributors, then growing
   it requires making it easier and more rewarding to contribute
   occasionally. Instead of trying to squeeze more work out of those
   who spend their life on Wikipedia, we need to broaden the base
   of those who contribute just a little bit."

web.py
------

   *December 6, 2005*

   > "The way I wrote web.py was simple: I imagined how things
   should work and then I made that happen. Sometimes making things
   just work takes a lot of code. Sometimes it only takes a little.
   But either way, that fact is hidden from the user — they just
   get the ideal API.

   > So how should things work? The first principle is that code
   should be clear and simple. If you want to output some text,
   you call web.output. If you want to get form input, you call
   web.input. There’s nothing particularly hard to remember.

   > The second principle is that web.py should fit your code, not
   the other way around. Every function in web.py is completely
   independent, you can use whichever ones you want. You can put
   your files wherever you like, and web.py will happily follow
   along. If you want a piece of code to be run as a web app, you
   call web.run, you don’t put your code in the magical place so
   that web.py can run you.

   > The third principle is that web.py should, by default, do the
   right thing by the Web. This means distinguishing between GET
   and POST properly. It means simple, canonical URLs which synonyms
   redirect to. It means readable HTML with the proper HTTP headers.

   > And that, as far as I’m concerned, are pretty much all the
   principles you need."

   "Hey Aaron - we're here at the unconference and I'm wondering
   if I maybe never sent you the details about where and when.  If
   not, I'm sorry!  I must've assumed that you're on the lists and
   would have seen the details that way.

   We're at the embassy suites, room 103, near the main conference
   registration desk.  Stop by if you can!

    -Dan"

   Oh no - that sounds awful.  I hope whatever's happened is going
   to work out.

   If you can get over here, we'd be glad to see you, whenever."
